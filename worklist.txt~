To Dos:
- Create ROS# subscriber for pointclouds
  - PointCloud.cs appears to be a message file for Pointclouds
  - Need to get a subscriber
  - Counter idea: could pull in depth values with image and offset manually
- Orient pointcloud properly in Unity
- Work on pointcloud rendering
- Clean up structure & library

Future Directions:
- Integrate into LEAP
- Subscription to more topics, recreate scene very well
- Publisher to relay LEAP movements

Useful Things to Remember:
- Image & Time Reference messages have been deleted from the "common_msgs" folder as they were recreate and / or had programming errors.
- Had to completely delete common_msgs & rtabmap folders to get Rviz to work (topics had same name is my guess)
- Voxel cloud is very useful for rendering pointclouds
- The nonauto-generated pointcloud.cs seems to be generated via depth & rgb images
