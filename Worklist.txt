Log:

1) RealSense SDK2.0 installed both Debian Package & Linux Installion
   - Seem to have created two sets of rules, may need to delete to reduce redundancy
   - Hardware timestamp is not working, could be an issue, probably not.
   - Make sure frameware is up to date and such

2) ROS Melodic Installed

3) Intel RealSense ROS installed from sources.
   - Seems to be working...not entirely sure how to verify however.
   - Seems all dependent packages are installed properly, again, no idea how to verify
   - Check .travis.yml file--may provide some hints.

4) ROS Wrapper installed
   - Starts and recognizes camera fine, get errors concerning timestamp
   - Rviz seems to be running as well, but I'm receiving no pointcloud data. Metaframe error of sorts. Gotta fix this.

To Dos:

1) Fix ROS Wrapper, get RViz to display images, probably debug the metaframe error. Later,  determine how to actually *save* pointcloud data

2) Other options for creating meshes. May be able to avoid ROS altogether. Save as a nuclear option.

3) Get SLAM up and running. Find out exactly what needs to be done with it.

4) Continue to develop a better understanding of what, exactly, ROS does & how.
