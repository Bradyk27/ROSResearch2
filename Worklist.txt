Okay so:

I got Unity up and running (for the most part). Works with PLY files in little-endian. Great.
- Polygons & faces and such

Problem:
I currently have PCD files. I found a Unity extension that *supposedly* will take PCD files, but only BINARY PCD files that of which I currently have ASCII. Which is pointing me ALL THE WAY BACK to the PointCloudLibrary. PCL has capability to convert PCD files & convert PCD to PLY or whatever else tf I want. 

Gotta install PCL then and figure out how it works. I think I got it installed, but, when I try to run a sample project, I get a bizarre error telling me that C++ 14 is not supported (even though my clang version DEFINITELY does).

So, to do:
1) Make PCL compile w/ C++14
2) Figure out how to get it to work
	- Either using RoS to run individual commands
	- Or cranking out some C++ code.
3) Convert my PCD to PLY
4) Import to Unity.
